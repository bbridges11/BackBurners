# Description: 
This app helps manage day to day bills easier in addition to keeping track of payments and deposits. The app is able to keep track of digital subscriptions such as Netflix, Amazon Prime and utility bills such as water or electricity. Trackers in the app will also monitor automatic payments and notify users of any price changes. The app reminds its users through push notifications when to make payments or to cancel a subscription if needed. Bank accounts can be accessed to fetch subscription info or it can be manually inputted. This app is useful to anyone with bills to pay or even people who want to keep better track of their spending. The app will be usable on iOS and Android smartphones, with plans to develop a website for computer access in the future.
